# DocMaps

DocMaps is a framework for representing the editorial processes used to create journal articles, preprints, peer reviews, and other documents in a machine-readable, extensible, interoperable format.

## Interested in Joining Us?

Weâ€™re looking for other groups interested in implementing DocMaps: publishers of reviews, developers of publishing or reviewing platforms that are interested in generating DocMaps, and aggregation or database services that are interested in collecting or displaying them. In addition to being able to offer technical support, we can also offer modest direct development funding for groups that need financial support to invest in DocMaps.

Get involved by contributing to our [code](https://github.com/Docmaps-Project/docmaps) or [RFC GitHub repos](https://github.com/Docmaps-Project/rfcs), or by emailing Project Lead Emily Esten at docmaps @ knowledgefutures.org.
